Now that we are manipulating these assets, not just spawning them into the scene, the choice of geometry we use to represent the letters impacts the physics of our simulation!. By setting `use_bbox_collision_geometry=True`, we are choosing to model the letters with their _Axis-Aligned Bounding Box_. This means that when MultibodyPlant is evaluating the dynamics of the scene, it will treat the letters as rectangular boxes. \n",

    "In the above figures, notice that the coordinate frames are not actually placed at the center of the letters. Instead they are placed at their bottom-left corners. Defining grasp poses relative to these origins are tricky, because we want the robot gripper to be centered above the letter, but the letter-width varies with different initials. In the below function, let `S` describe the object frame as it is used in the SDF file corresponding to the geometry of the letter. Let `O` describe a frame placed at the center of mass of the object. The pick and place poses we defined above have frame `O` in mind, so let's make sure that that is the frame we are using. "
